# Timed-Coding-Quiz
## Description
- AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. 
- The quiz had the following requirements:
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
- This repo provides the user with all of requirements (except timer subtracting) as well as an indicator for a correct or incorrect answer and a brief timeout before the next question was asked. Once all questions were answered there was an input box to save your score and a highscores button to view all high scores. 
## Installation
- Follow the link provided below and click the 'Start' button.
## Usage
- Click start to begin, answer the questions by clicking on the box containing the answer you chose. Once questions are completed you can enter your initials and click the save button to save your score. If you return to the homepage you can view high scores.

- - I learned that getting to know how to save things in local storage and getting more familiar with other web APIs that it's starting to make things a little easier and concepts more tangible. Still struggled for many days with what seem to be relatively easy things.
## Credits

- I tried to finish this project using this tutorial first but ran into a problem with the high scores page. After watching the video above I realized where my problems were but I had nearly everything working already so I decided to stick with the multiple html css and js pages.
